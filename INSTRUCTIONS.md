# Introduction & what is expected
Welcome to the frontend challenge. The main idea is to create an app
connected to an external API and show results from it. There will be no
design, so you have absolute freedom in this aspect.
The purpose of the challenge is to build a single page application with React,
showing a list of items with some information in each of them, and another
page showing detailed information of each item.
Here you have a list of public APIs you can use for the challenge, but you
can use another one, if you want:
https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis
Some recommendations: Marvel; SWAPI.

## There will be two principal screens in the app:
### Listing:
- It will show a list of items coming from the API, with some
information. Title is mandatory.
- The app will be able to order the items by (at least) the Title.
- The app will be able to filter the items by some of the fields. It
could be a property from the items with any select or checkbox or
a search field, or all of them.
### Detail:
- It will show detailed information of the selected element.

the repository.
